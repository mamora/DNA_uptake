The objective of this script is to find a sintenic region between PittGG and 86-028NP that could be used to use as a representative example to plot uptake maps. Ideally we need a syntenic region without indels or inversions. 


First I aligned the PittGG and 86-028NP genomic sequences using MAUVE software with **progressiveMAUVE** alignment.  

This aligment produced colinear segments that were aligned between both genomes.

From this alignment I chose the colinear segment 1 (yellow). This segment is chosen since t is the longest and it is not split  in different parts of the same genome.

## Analysis done with bash, or in my case in Cygwin bash

**this scripts cannot be run directly in rmarkdown, or maybe they can?  Run them in your bash or Cygwin termnal**

The MAUVE alignment create 4 file. One of those files, the one without a extension, has all the colinear blocks. I took that file and I split each of the blocks in separate files


```{bash eval=FALSE}

csplit --digits=3  --quiet --prefix=colinear testing_script "/=/+1" "{*}"

```


Next I extracted the names and te horder in which the sequences included. This can be done manually or with the script below 


```{bash eval=FALSE}
grep -o -P '(?<=datasets\\).*(?=.f)' colinear001 > names.txt

#where "datasets\" is the folder where the fasta files are stored and ".f" is the beggining of the fasta file extension (I had two extensions .fasta and .fa, so I used just the begining)

#if the fasta files are saved outside the datasets folder the script won't work

```

Now I extracted the genomic coordinates of the begining and end of the colinear block

```{bash eval=FALSE}

grep -o -P '(?<=>).*(?=C)' colinear001 > coord.txt


```

Finally, extracted begining and end coordinates in different files to import them into R  

```{bash eval=FALSE}

grep -o -P '(?<=:).*(?=-)' coord.txt > left.txt

 grep -o -P '(?<=-)[0-9]*(?= +)' coord.txt > right.txt

```

## R analysis

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Load the various functions used below from the "pssmFunctions.R" file,
# as if the whole file were copy-pasted to the R command-line
source("~/DNA_uptake/helper_functions/pssmFunctions1.R")

source("~/DNA_uptake/helper_functions/functions_syntenic.R")


#This next step involves reading with R the colinear aligned sequences from both genomes. This step requires extracting manualy the sequences, from the colinear001 file, and saving them in separate files. 

# Name the sites file, and genome reference file
np.block    <- "np.fasta" # colinear fasta to the NP genome
PittGG.block    <- "PittGG.fasta" # colinear fasta to the PittGG genome

# Read in genome
colinear.np <- read.genome(np.block) # read fasta with seqinr, then massage

# Read in genome
colinear.PittGG <- read.genome(PittGG.block) # read fasta with seqinr, then massage

length(colinear.np[[1]]) - length(colinear.PittGG[[1]]) # checking that the sequences are properly aligned --> result must be 0


```



Now I need to make a dataframe with the genomic position limits of the aligned block. This positions were obtained from the alinment file of Mauve


Start with the aligned positions of colinear1, but the script can be adapter fr any colinear segment


```{r}

#get the start sequence position of the aligned sequences
left<- read.delim("./left.txt", header = FALSE)[,1]

str(left)


#get the end sequence position of the aligned sequences
right<- read.delim("./right.txt", header = FALSE)[,1]

str(right)


# get the strain names
samples<- read.delim("./names.txt", header = FALSE)

str(samples)

samples

#make a dataframe with the genomic positions limits corresponing to the aligned sequences 
block1<- data.frame(samples = samples, left = left, right = right)

block1$right[2] - block1$left[2]

```

Next I will arrange the aligned colinear sequences into a matrix


```{r}
#create a matrix with sequences as numbers and genomic positions
m<- synthetic(block = block1,colinear.PittGG, colinear.np)

# add a first row
first.row<- c("NP_sequence", "PittGG_sequence", "NP_positions", "PittGG_positions")

# Add rownames
rownames(m) <-first.row

View(m[1:4,1:20]) 

```


Making then matrix of aligned sequences a dataframe to plot

```{r}

str(block.d)
